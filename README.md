# Explanatory-Style-Transfer-Project
Purpose
Explanatory style refers to how individuals interpret the causes of events in their lives. According to the reformulated learned helplessness model, people with a pessimistic explanatory style are more likely to experience helplessness and related difficulties when facing negative events, compared to those with an optimistic style.
This project aims to reduce the risk of depression by transforming pessimistic explanatory patterns—characterized by stable, global, and internal attributions—into more optimistic ones, which are unstable, specific, and external.
