# Explanatory-Style-Transfer-Project
## Purpose

Explanatory style refers to how individuals interpret the causes of events in their lives. According to the reformulated learned helplessness model, people with a pessimistic explanatory style are more likely to experience helplessness and related difficulties when facing negative events, compared to those with an optimistic style.

This project aims to reduce the risk of depression by rating and transforming pessimistic explanatory patterns—characterized by stable, global, and internal attributions—into more optimistic ones, which are unstable, specific, and external.

## steps
### First step - rating
1. Provide basic definitions of different explanatory styles.
2. Provide scoring criteria.
3. Offer several annotated examples to illustrate the scoring process.
4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
   
This will enable the agent to identify the attribution style in a sentence and assign an appropriate score.
### Second step - Transfering
After providing the rating, transform sentences with scores of 1–3 (indicating a pessimistic explanatory style) into sentences that reflect an optimistic explanatory style.

### Final step - integration
Combine the three agents into a unified workflow that can identify the most prominent attribution dimension in the input sentence, assign a score, and perform the appropriate reattribution. This makes the system more aligned with real-world usage.

## Example
